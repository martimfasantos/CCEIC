## First presentation (1 min) - 18.9

Have you ever heard of self-driving cars? What about robots that can speak? 

Well, my name is Martim and I'm a __computer engineer__, which means I love __solving puzzles__ and creating __cool machines__ like those.

I'm like a __superhero__ but instead of a cape, I use my __computer__ and my superpower is a __super brain__ that loves to solve problems! 

And you know what's __even cooler?__ I get to use my love for science to work on something special just for you all!!

It's called __"Science for Kids"__, and it's like a __magical world of Science__ with a lottt of different __mysteries__ that you can explore __with your friends!!__

So, what do you say? Are you ready to learn about science while having some fun?

## Group presentation (average 2 min per person)

>_... (Intro)_

Have you ever tried to explain a technical term to someone outside your field, only to be faced with blank stares and confusion? Well, I have and believe me, it can be very frustrating. However, with the right linguistic techniques, it’s possible to break down even the most complex terms into relatable and understandable words. 

Today, we'll be sharing with you some powerful techniques for bridging the gap between technical and non-technical audiences, and unlocking a whole new level of effective communication.

>_... (After João - analogies)_

Additionally, you can use metaphors to describe technical concepts in a way that isn’t literally true but makes it more relatable and easier to understand. For example: "Encryption is like a secret code that only the intended recipient is able decode"

>_... (after João - Classification)_

Lastly, providing concrete examples of where the technical terms are used in the real-world can make it not only easier to understand but also easier to remember as well.

>_... (after João - Papers)_

Some great examples found on these papers are:

Comparing a computer's hard drive to a file cabinet. Imagine João is an elderly person who isn't aware of the new technologies: this analogy would help to explain how data is stored in a computer by comparing it to a physical file cabinet where data is kept and retrieved.

Another examples is: Comparing an algorithm to a recipe: Now imagine Guilherme loves cooking. With this metaphor it is easy to explain to Guilherme how computer algorithms work by comparing them to a recipe that follows a set of instructions, something that he knows very well. But imagine Guilherme was a small little kid who doesn't know what a recipe is, would this example be helpful?

> _... (after Guilherme - Discussion)_

And to an engineer?

In this next activity, we would like you to try to explain the term “Email” to an elderly person and to a child. Which techniques would you use? Can you give an example?

Are you looking for a person who can deliver great results while bring creativity, innovation, and a can-do attitude to the table? Look no further because that's exactly what you'll find in me, Martim Santos, and I'm here to show you why.

So, <span style="color:red">__who am I__</span>? I am a 21 years old student currently completing my <span style="color:red">__Master's Degree in Computer Science__</span> in Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisboa. My areas of expertise include AI and Data Science, where I have gained in-depth knowledge and proficiency.

My academic achievements have been truly remarkable, with excellent projects and grades in multiple courses. Over the past 4 years, I have been actively developing and putting into practice a diverse set of <span style="color:red">__technical skills__</span> in various programming languages and code libraries.

I've' always been driven to go the extra mile in my pursuit of learning and continuous improvement. Therefore, I have been also working on other independent personal projects, such as a Web-portfolio and different Neural Network-based projects, amongst others.<span style="color:gray"> (70secs)</span>

Starting my career with a clean slate, I am confident that my knowledge and skills can be helpful in a <span style="color:red">__professional environment__</span>. I am a <span style="color:red">__problem solver__</span> who enjoys taking on challenges and a <span style="color:red">__strong communicator__</span> who works well in <span style="color:red">__team environments__</span>. I am also <span style="color:red">__very committed, versatile__</span> and able to <span style="color:red">__learn new skills quickly__</span>.

My <span style="color:red">__professional goals__</span> are to work in the fields of Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. These fields can make a <span style="color:red">__significant impact on society__</span>, and I'm <span style="color:red">__eager to contribute__</span> my skills to make that happen since it has always been <span style="color:red">__my passion__</span>.
